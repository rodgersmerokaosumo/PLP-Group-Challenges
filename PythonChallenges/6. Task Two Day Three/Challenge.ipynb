        "Calories from Fat and Carbohydrates A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula: \n",
        "Calories from fats fat grams * 9 \n",
