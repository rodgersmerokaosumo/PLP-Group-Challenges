# Authentication System
- use this link to access the site [to-do-list-grp-8.netlify.app](https://to-do-list-grp-8.netlify.app/)
- the team created an authentication system that used vanilla Javascript that a login page will authenticate a user. After a successful login, the user will be taken to the To-Do list website.
- login page where a user will use the default credentials to sign in

- now when the user enters wrong credentials an error alert appears. But after successfully signing in is done, the page will redirect to the To-Do list website <br>
